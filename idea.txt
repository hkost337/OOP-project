I propose to create a software model for a uniform rental service. This model will utilize object-oriented programming principles and polymorphism to simulate the operations and interactions within the service.

Core Classes:

Uniform (Abstract Base Class):

Properties:
uniformID (unique identifier)
type (e.g., "formal", "industrial", "medical")
size
material
rentalStatus (e.g., "available", "rented", "cleaning")
Methods:
calculateRentalFee() (abstract – to be implemented in derived classes)
processReturn() (abstract – to be implemented in derived classes)
FormalUniform, IndustrialUniform, MedicalUniform (Derived Classes):

Properties: (Inherit from Uniform)
Methods:
calculateRentalFee() (Implementation specific to each uniform type)
processReturn() (Implementation specific to each uniform type, e.g., dry cleaning for formal, industrial wash for industrial)
Customer:

Properties:
customerID
name
contactInformation
Methods:
placeOrder()
returnUniform()
viewRentalHistory()
Order:

Properties:
orderID
customerID (reference to Customer object)
uniformIDs (list of uniform IDs in the order)
rentalStartDate
rentalEndDate
Methods:
calculateTotalFee()

The calculateRentalFee() method will be polymorphic, allowing each uniform type to calculate its rental fee differently (e.g., higher fees for formal wear, longer rental periods may have discounts).
The processReturn() method will also exhibit polymorphism. Each uniform type will have its specific return process (e.g., dry cleaning for formal wear, specialized cleaning for medical uniforms).
